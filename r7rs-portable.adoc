= R7RS: Portable Guide

R7RS is the current standard. The language has been divided into 
two parts.

R7RS-small:: defines the core language, and extends the earlier R5RS standard
with exception handling, libraries and records, amongst other additions.
The R7RS report can be found under the https://standards.scheme.org/[standards]
menu. 

R7RS-large:: is still under development, and aims to define a set of libraries
"focused on the practical needs of mainstream software development." R7RS-large
is being developed in dockets, each docket known by a color and focusing on a
different set of libraries - for example, the Red docket mostly contains data
structures.  Information on the progress and planned future of R7RS-large is
available at
https://github.com/johnwcowan/r7rs-work/blob/master/R7RSHomePage.md


== Implementation Support

The following table shows any command-line flags required to put the Scheme 
implementation into R7RS mode.

[cols="1a,2a"]
|=====
| Implementation | R7RS Mode Flags

|Chibi-Scheme 
|`chibi-scheme` (R7RS mode is the default)

|Chicken 
|`csc -R r7rs` and `csi -R r7rs`

|Cyclone 
|`cyclone` and `icyc` (R7RS mode is the default)

|Gambit 
|`gsc -:r7rs` and `gsi -:r7rs`

|Gauche 
|`gosh -r 7`

|Gerbil 
|`gxi --lang r7rs`

|Guile 
|`guile --r7rs`

|Kawa 
|`kawa --r7rs`

|Larceny 
|`larceny -r7rs`

|Sagittarius 
|`sagittarius -r 7` and `sash -r 7`

|=====

The levels of R7RS-large support vary. Gauche and Sagittarius
support all of the Red and Tangerine dockets, with the new R7RS-large names
(see
https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/man/gauche-refe/R7RS-large.html#R7RS-large[Gauche]
and http://ktakashi.github.io/sagittarius-ref.html#G2104[Sagittarius] manuals).
Most implementations do, however, support many of the required SRFIs:
SRFI support is documented at https://docs.scheme.org/srfi/support/[].

== R7RS Large Edition

The following series of tables give a summary of the libraries covered by the
Red and Tangerine dockets (arranged into groups of related functionality) and
the Yellow docket. The second column links to some documentation for each
library: most of these libraries are based on existing SRFIs and, for
portability, it is recommended to use the SRFI imports to get at these
libraries.

=== Formatting

This library provides a scheme-like way of formatting text by constructing
s-expressions, as opposed to using text interpolation. (Note: the Tangerine
Edition refers to SRFI 159, but that has been _withdrawn_ in favour of SRFI
166.)

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme show)` 
| http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-159/srfi-159.html[(srfi 159)] 
| Formatting text.
|===

=== Regular Expressions

This library, like `show`, provides a scheme-like way of describing regular
expressions using s-expressions.

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme regex)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-115/srfi-115.html[(srfi 115)]
| Regular expressions.
|===

=== Data Types

Text:: This library introduces an immutable form of a string, called a `text`.
The rationale for this library is that more efficient operations can be
implemented for strings which are immutable, particularly if they are
unicode-encoded.  Helpfully, many of the implemented operations work on
"textual" objects, which includes both the new immutable `text` data type and
regular `string` values.

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme text)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-135/srfi-135.html[(srfi 135)]
| Immutable strings.
|===

Numbers:: These libraries provide additional functionality and potentially
efficient implementations for working with numbers. 

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme division)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-141/srfi-141.html[(srfi 141)]
| Provides six different ways of computing the quotient and remainder (`q` and `r`) when dividing an integer `n` so that `n = dq+r`.

| `(scheme bitwise)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-151/srfi-151.html[(srfi 151)]
| Treats integers as twos-complement numbers, and provides a complete set of operators for manipulating integers in bitwise form.

| `(scheme fixnum)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-143/srfi-143.html[(srfi 143)]
| Provides efficient implementations of operations on integers which are "small enough" to be treated within a single machine word.

| `(scheme flonum)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-144/srfi-144.html[(srfi 144)]
| Provides efficient implementations of operations on flonums, a subset of the full range of inexact real numbers. 
|===

=== Data Structures

Data structures (collections) have been a major focus of R7RS-large
development.  The small language has built-in the list and vector datatypes, a
specialisation of vector to bytevectors, and a simple mapping pattern in the
form of association lists.

Set-like:: Designed to hold one or more values without any additional
structure, such as order, imposed on them. Set-like structures may enforce
unique values (sets) or permit multiple values (bags, or multi-sets).

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme box)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html[(srfi 111)]
| Provides a single-item container.

| `(scheme set)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-113/srfi-113.html[(srfi 113)]
| Provides both `set` and `bag` data structures, along with a wide-range of supporting functions.

| `(scheme charset)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/srfi-14.html[(srfi 14)]
| Deals specifically with sets of characters, making available some predefined character sets, and operations to work with such sets.
|===

List-like:: Designed to hold one or more values in a specific order. Values can
be duplicated within the data structure.

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme list)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html[(srfi 1)]
| Provides a wide-range of functions working with the built-in list datatype.

| `(scheme ilist)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-116/srfi-116.html[(srfi 116)]
| Provides an immutable version of the built-in `list` along with functions equivalent to those in the `list` library, where appropriate.

| `(scheme rlist)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-101/srfi-101.html[(srfi 101)]
| An alternative to the built-in `list`, but offers more efficient references (`rlist-ref` is O(log n)) and a functional interface.  Note that, unlike the SRFI, the R7RS-large version prefixes identifiers with "r" to avoid name-clashes with `list`.

| `(scheme ideque)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-134/srfi-134.html[(srfi 134)]
| Provides an immutable deque data struture, a double-ended queue which supports efficient (O(1)) adding/removal of items from either end.

| `(scheme list-queue)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-117/srfi-117.html[(srfi 117)]
| A mutable deque data structure, which offers efficient adding/removal of items from the front and adding of items to the back.
|===

Vectors are a variant of lists, which hold values in a specific order and
provide O(1) look-up time using a numeric index. The different types allow for
specialisation in terms of the particular contents. 

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme vector)`
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-133/srfi-133.html[(srfi 133)]
| Provides a wide-range of functions working with the built-in vector datatype.

| `(scheme bytevector)` 
| http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-3.html#node_chap_2[(rnrs bytevectors)]
| Taken from R6RS.

| `(scheme vector @)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-160/srfi-160.html[(srfi 160)]
| Provide homogeneous equivalents to the `vector` type and library for specific numeric types; these can potentially be implemented more efficiently than the general form.
|===

Map-like:: Collections of key-value pairs, where a key is used to retrieve a
value stored within the collection. They can be thought of as a generalisation
of the vector, except that any type of value can be used as the index, not just
a number.

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme hash-table)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-125/srfi-125.html[(srfi 125)]
| Provides a standard hash table data structure.

| `(scheme mapping)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-146/srfi-146.html[(srfi 146)]
| Provides a more general data structure than `hash-table`, supporting functional procedures.
|===

Stream-like:: These data structures do not store _existing_ values, but instead
_construct_ new values on demand. 

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| `(scheme generator)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-158/srfi-158.html[(srfi 158)]
| Provides both "generators" and "accumulators". A generator is a zero-argument procedure that acts as a source of values; an accumulator is a single-argument procedure that acts as a sink of values.

| `(scheme lseq)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-127/srfi-127.html[(srfi 127)]
| A list where the "cdr" element is a generator; this is similar to `stream` except that the lists are _odd_, so the first element is eager evaluated.

| `(scheme stream)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-41/srfi-41.html[(srfi 41)]
| Provides low-level and higher-level support for lazy lists; lists where each item is constructed on demand. These lists are _even_, so both elements are lazy evaluated.
|===

=== Utility

These libraries are used to support data structures.

[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| R7RS Name | Documentation | Description

| `(scheme comparator)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-128/srfi-128.html[(srfi 128)]
| Bundles together the equality, comparison and hash functions for different data-types, so they can be used in the construction of a data structure for a specific type of data. This library is used in: `hash-table`, `mapping`, and `set`.

| `(scheme ephemeron)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-124/srfi-124.html[(srfi 124)]
| Can be used to implement data structures with weak references, which permit garbage collection.

| `(scheme sort)` 
| https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-132/srfi-132.html[(srfi 132)]
| A collection of sort, merge and related functions, working on the built-in list and vector datatypes.

== R7RS Large Edition dockets

R7RS-large is developed by assigning candidate SRFIs to *color dockets* that
concern different aspects of the language. Over time, the language working
group (WG2) selects the most appropriate SRFIs from each docket to go into the
final language.

[cols="1a,2a"]

|Docket|Concerns

|Red|data structures
|Tangerine|numerics
|Orange|numerics
|Amber|syntax
|Yellow|syntax
|Lime|portable
|Green|non-portable
|Olive|non-portable
|Aqua|portable but complex things
|Blue|portable but advanced things
|Indigo|stuff of dubious utility
