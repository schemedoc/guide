# Arrays and vectors

## Lists vs vectors

Like most Lisp dialects, Scheme is based heavily around the _list_
datatype. Around Lisp and most functional programming languages, the
word _list_ always refers to a _linked list_ built out of _pairs_,
where each pair contains one list element and a pointer to the next
pair.

Also like most Lisp dialects, Scheme has a built-in _vector_ datatype.
Whereas a list is built out of out of interlinked but still separate
objects, a vector is a single object. The _elements_ of a vector are
still separate objects from the vector itself, but the "spine" of the
vector that holds the elements together is not divided into parts the
way the "spine" of a list is.

## Efficiency

The reason for a separate vector datatype is efficiency. Every link in
a linked list takes up a little memory. By contrast, a _n_-element
vector is stored internally as an array of _n_ machine words. An
additional machine word is not needed for each element to point to the
next pair: since a machine word takes up a constant number of bytes in
memory, the memory address of the _k_'th element (using zero-based
indexing) is simply _k_ times the machine word size. Hence vector
lookup is a constant-time operation, whereas list lookup is O(_n_).

The advantages of (linked) lists are:

* A list can share structure with one or more other lists.
* Inserting an element at the head of the list is an O(1) operation;
  for a vector it is O(n).

## Vectors vs arrays

A vector is a one-dimensional array. Unlike Common Lisp, Scheme does
not have a standard multi-dimensional array type. (An _m_-by-_n_ array
can be simulated using a vector with _m_ * _n_ elements.) However, a
few Scheme implementations do have a real array datatype.

## Standard vector types

Scheme has had a standard *vector* datatype since R2RS (1985). This
type can store any mix of arbitrary Scheme objects as its elements.

Since R6RS (2007) there has also been a standard *bytevector*
datatype. As the name implies, its elements can only be exact integers
in the range 0..255. This makes it very fast and compact to handle raw
bytes. The standard *string\->utf8* and *utf8\->string* procedures
help convert between strings and bytevectors.

## Non-standard numeric vector types

SRFI 4 (_Homogeneous numeric vector datatypes_) supplies vectors
specialized to store a particular type of number.

### Integer vectors

* u8vector -- vector of *unsigned* 8-bit exact integers
* s8vector -- vector of *signed* 8-bit exact integers
* u16vector -- etc.
* s16vector -- vector of *signed* 16-bit exact integers
* u32vector
* s32vector
* u64vector
* s64vector

The *u8vector* type is the same as the standard *bytevector* type.
SRFI 4 was written before R6RS, so bytevectors didn't yet exist.

### Floating-point vectors

* f32vector -- vector of (at least) 32-bit inexact real numbers
* f64vector -- vector of (at least) 64-bit inexact real numbers

### Complex vectors

SRFI 160 is a backward-compatible update of SRFI 4 that adds:

* c64vector -- vector of complex numbers with 64-bit real part and 64-bit imaginary part
* c128vector

### Fixnum vectors

Chez Scheme provides a *fxvector* type. It's a vector that stores
*fixnum* values -- exact integers with a range that is the most
convenient for the implementation to handle efficiently. Typically
this range is the size of a machine word minus a few bits reserved for
type tags.

## Non-standard array types

SRFI 25 (_Multi-dimensional Array Primitives_) provides

## Types in Scheme implementations

Every implementation below has the standard *vector* type.
