# Text processing

This is a guide for common character and string tasks.

## Data types

Scheme has had standard _string_ and _character_ datatypes since
forever. They are fully distinct types: a character is neither a
string nor an integer. _String_, _bytevector_, _vector_ and _list_ are
also distinct types: none of them is a subtype of another.

### Unicode and multi-byte character encodings

A Scheme character object represents one Unicode codepoint.
*char->integer* and *integer->char* convert between integer codepoints
and character objects. `(map char->integer (string->list s))` shows
all the codepoints in the string _s_.

### Mutable vs immutable strings

Scheme strings are generally mutable. This means you can change
individual characters in the string using *string-set!* at any time
after the string has been created.

_However,_ actual Scheme code that mutates strings is somewhat rare.
It is generally best to avoid mutating them if you can manage without.
In the medium-to-long term, Scheme may evolve in a direction where
strings are immutable, or where mutable strings are second-class
citizens and immutable strings are the default thing to use.

## Libraries

Scheme has had several standard *char-* and *string-* procedures since
forever (R2RS). Since R6RS they have been Unicode-aware.

*SRFI 13* (_String Libraries_) is the most popular library for extra
convenience. *SRFI 130* (_Cursor-based string library_) is mostly a
drop-in replacement, but additionally supports _string cursors_ for
walking a string character-by-character while keeping track of the
current position.

*R7RS:* If you don't need string cursors, you can use the following
*cond-expand*. It will import whichever one of 130 and 13 is available
in any given Scheme implementation. Almost all R7RS Schemes come with
one or both libraries.

-----
(cond-expand ((library (srfi 130)) (import (srfi 130)))
             ((library (srfi 13))  (import (srfi 13))))
-----

## Classify characters

* *char-alphabetic?*
* *char-numeric?*
* *char-whitespace?*
* *char-upper-case?*
* *char-lower-case?*

*SRFI 175* (_ASCII character library_) has ASCII-only versions of
these.

## Compare characters

* *char-ci=?*
* *char-ci<?*
* *char-ci>?*
* *char-ci<=?*
* *char-ci>=?*

## Compare strings

* *string-ci=?*
* *string-ci<?*
* *string-ci>?*
* *string-ci<=?*
* *string-ci>=?*

## Change letter case

* *char-upcase*
* *char-downcase*

* *string-upcase*
* *string-downcase*

*SRFI 129* (_Titlecase procedures_) has Unicode-aware title-casing.

## Convert between numbers and text

*string->number* and *number->string* deal with Scheme syntax.
(*number->string* _number_ _base_) can output binary, octal or
hexadecimal numbers.

*digit-value* (standard in R7RS) converts an individual character to a
number.

## Convert between bytes and text

*string->utf8* and *utf8->string* take care of most needs.

## Programming tactics

### Making new strings

Scheme does not have lazy strings (or "ropes"). Doing (*string-append*
_a_ _b_) makes copies of the underlying bytes of both _a_ and _b_. The
resulting string does not share structure with _a_ or _b_. This means
building new strings is somewhat expensive.

### Building a string one character at a time

*list->string* allows accumulating individual characters into a list
and then turning them into a string at the end. This is fast enough
for everyday tasks.

-----
(let letters ((cc (char->integer #\a)) (chars '()))
  (if (<= cc (char->integer #\z))
      (letters (+ cc 1) (cons (integer->char cc) chars))
      (list->string (reverse chars))))
-----

Same without the *reverse*:

-----
(let letters ((cc (char->integer #\z)) (chars '()))
  (if (< cc (char->integer #\a))
      (list->string chars)
      (letters (- cc 1) (cons (integer->char cc) chars))))
-----

### Building a string as if writing to a port

R7RS has a standard *open-output-string* procedure. Writing to a
string output port can be faster (and in some cases more convenient)
than *list->string*.

-----
(call-with-port (open-output-string)
  (lambda (out)
    (let letters ((cc (char->integer #\a)))
      (cond ((<= cc (char->integer #\z))
             (write-char (integer->char cc) out)
             (letters (+ cc 1)))
            (else (get-output-string out))))))
-----

### Reading text from ports

*read-char* (R7RS) a.k.a *get-char* (R6RS) reads a character at a time
from a string port. In some cases, using a byte port instead of a
string port can yield an approach that is more resilient against
character encoding gotchas, and *utf8->string* can be called once
after reading a bytevector instead of constructing the string
character-by-character.

### Reading from strings

A string can be iterated by incrementing the character index in a
loop:

-----
(define (display-chars s)
  (let ((n (string-length s)))
    (let loop ((i 0))
      (when (< i n)
        (display (string-ref s i))
        (newline)
        (loop (+ i 1))))))
-----

*string-ref* is a constant-time operation in implementations that
store string characters internally as a vector of 32-bit integers.
Implementations that store a string as UTF-8 generally have to
traverse the string from the beginning for each *string-ref*.

### Reading from strings as if they were ports

R7RS has a standard *open-input-string* procedure. Reading from a
string port can be faster than *string-ref* depending on the
implemnetation.
