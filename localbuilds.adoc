# Local builds

## Introduction

This guide explains how to make your own local builds of various
Scheme implementations. That's useful if you want to:

* use pre-release versions to get the very latest features

* use custom build options

* use an operating system that does not have a ready-to-run package of
  the Scheme you want

## Installation prefix

On Unix-like operating systems, programs intended for all users are
usually installed into `/usr` or `/usr/local`.

For your own personal use, an emerging convention is to install into
`~/.local`, i.e. a directory named `.local` under your home directory.
This guide adopts that convention.

Most Schemes have a *prefix* option in their build system that can be
used to set the installation prefix to any directory you like. Hence,
if you want something different than `~/.local`, just change the
prefix.

## Chibi-Scheme

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|C interpreter and OS interface, Scheme libraries
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|GNU make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|2 minutes
|*Documentation:*|`doc/chibi.scrbl` (_Installation_ section)
|=====

-----
git clone https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme.git
cd chibi-scheme
make PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local
-----

To run installed chibi you need to setup `$CHIBI_MODULE_PATH` (running
uninstalled does not need this because chibi can detect in that case).

-----
export CHIBI_MODULE_PATH=$HOME/.local/share/chibi:$HOME/.local/lib/chibi
-----

You may need to adjust `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as well because chibi-scheme
binary does not have a default path for libchibi-scheme.so (you should
see "error while loading shared libraries" if it's the case)

-----
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/.local/lib
-----

### Testing uninstalled versions

./tools/chibi-run

### Troubleshooting

Chibi requires GNU `make`. On BSD systems, use `gmake` in place of
`make`.

When you first run `make` it creates the file
`include/chibi/install.h`. The constant `sexp_default_module_path` in
that file is seeded from the `PREFIX` you gave to `make`. If you later
run `make` with a different `PREFIX` that `.h` file will not be
regenerated and will have a stale library path. Even `make clean`
won't get rid of it. The solution is `make cleaner`.

## CHICKEN

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|Scheme, some C
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|GNU make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|7 minutes
|*Documentation:*|`README` (_Bootstrapping_ section)
|=====

The CHICKEN project occasionally publishes prerelease
https://code.call-cc.org/dev-snapshots/[development snapshots] which
you can use to bootstrap from when you want to build from Git.

These snapshots require just a C compiler and specifically GNU make.
If you are on a system where `make` refers to BSD make, use `gmake` or
`gnumake` instead of `make` in the command below.

To make things easy, there's a script in the git repository which will
perform the bootstrapping for you:

-----
git clone git://code.call-cc.org/chicken-core
PLATFORM=linux ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
-----

When the bootstrap script is done, it prints instructions on what to
do next:

-----
Now, build chicken by passing "CHICKEN=./chicken-boot" to make,
in addition to PREFIX, PLATFORM, and other parameters.
-----

Let's do just that:

-----
make PLATFORM=linux CHICKEN=./chicken-boot PREFIX=$HOME/.local install
-----

## Cyclone

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|TBD
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|TBD
|*Documentation:*|TBD
|=====

Cyclone requires an installed version to bootstrap. If you haven't had
any, get it from `cyclone-bootstrap` repository

-----
git clone https://github.com/justinethier/cyclone-bootstrap.git
cd cyclone-boostrap
make PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make PREFIX=$HOME/.local install
-----

Now you can build latest cyclone version, the steps are exactly the
same:

-----
git clone https://github.com/justinethier/cyclone.git
cd cyclone
make PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make PREFIX=$HOME/.local install
-----

## Gambit

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|Scheme, with C for system interface
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|GNU autotools & make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|30 minutes
|=====

### The bootstrap process

Gambit requires a pre-built version of its `gsc` compiler in order to
bootstrap itself. `gsc` is written in Scheme, then transpiled into C
which is compiled into native executables using the system C compiler.
The C files are committed into Gambit's Git repository so that a
builder does not necessarily need to obtain a binary executable of
`gsc` to build Gambit on a new computer. It's enough to obtain the
Gambit Git repository and a C compiler.

The bootstrap compiler is an executable at the root of its source
directory by the name `gsc-boot`. If `gsc-boot` does not exist, `make`
tries to find a suitable compiler in the history of the local git
clone. For this reason, a shallow clone (`git clone --depth 1`) of
Gambit generally does not work.

The usual way to get Gambit going on a new machine is to first install
the latest release version, then use that to bootstrap the latest git
master.

-----
git clone https://github.com/gambit/gambit.git
cd gambit
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make modules
make install
-----

### Performance

#### Parallel builds

`make -j` can significantly speed up Gambit builds if you have a fast
multi-core CPU and lots of RAM.

#### Optimized single-host build

`./configure --enable-single-host` generates a version of Gambit on
which a good C compiler is able to do whole-program optimization. The
resulting Gambit binaries can be significantly faster for
performance-sensitive software. However, building Gambit this way
takes a lot longer and requires more than a gigabyte of RAM.

For pedestrian Scheme code there is little to no perceptible speed
difference, so a non-single-host build is fine. Even a non-single-host
Gambit is easily one of the fastest Scheme implementations available.

Pre-packaged binaries of Gambit are generally single-host builds.

#### GCC vs clang

GNU's `gcc` compiler builds Gambit significantly faster than LLVM's
`clang` compiler. Once Gambit has been built, there can be also
substantial speed difference (about 2x in some cases) between the
resulting executables.

On some operating systems, notably MacOS, the `gcc` command actually
runs `clang` (whose command-line interface is largely compatible with
GNU `gcc`). You can check this with `gcc --version`: the output should
say `LLVM` if it's actually clang.

On MacOS, you can install the real GNU GCC from Homebrew with:

`brew install gcc`

Homebrew installs GCC as `gcc-9` (where `9` is GCC's major version
number). You can find the precise command name with:

`brew list gcc | grep -E '/bin/gcc-[0-9]+$' | xargs basename`

You can set the compiler used to build Gambit like so:

`./configure CC=gcc-9`

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes big changes are made to Gambit which break your build,
causing compiler errors (or in rare cases, a crashing `gsc` or `gsi`
executable). In that case, try deleting the `boot` directory and the
`gsc-boot` executable within Gambit's source directory (`rm -rf boot/
gsc-boot`). That forces `make` to do a full bootstrap. Beware that
this can take 30 minutes or more.

## Gauche

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|C and Scheme
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|GNU autotools & make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|5 minutes
|*Documentation:*|HACKING.adoc
|=====


Gauche requires the latest released version installed before you can
build from Git repository. Follow the documentation link below to get
the tarball and install. Remember to add `--prefix` when you
configure:

-----
# Browse http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/download.html
tar -xf Gauche-0.9.9.tgz
cd Gauche-0.9.9
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make install
-----

After this, make sure "gosh" is available. If not adjust `$PATH` for
the current shell:

-----
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
-----

Now you can build from Git, the steps are almost identical as before,
except the new step `./DIST gen`.

-----
git clone https://github.com/shirok/Gauche.git gauche
cd gauche
./DIST gen
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make install
-----

## Gerbil

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|TBD
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|Scheme
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|TBD
|*Documentation:*|doc/guide/README.md and .travis.yml
|=====

Gerbil requires latest(?) Gambit Scheme installed. See above for more
instructions. After that the build instructions are quite simple.

-----
git clone https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil.git
cd gerbil/src
./build.sh stage0
./build.sh stage1 final
./build.sh stdlib
./build.sh lang
./build.sh tools
-----

Note that because parallel builds are not supported and build.sh
simply rebuilds everything. If you make changes in one part, stdlib
for instance, just run build.sh for that part only. Otherwise it make
take a long time.

Note sure about installation. Gerbil documents seem to encourage
running directly from source. The binaries are `bin/gxi` and
`bin/gxc`.

## Guile

You may need to install required packages. See README for details.

-----
git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/guile.git
cd guile
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make install

## Larceny

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|Scheme
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|Scheme and gcc
|*Full build without bootstrap:*|3 minutes
|*Documentation:*|doc/HOWTO-BUILD and doc/HOWTO-INSTALL
|=====

To build Larceny you need a Scheme system that can host Larceny. The
easiest option is the prebuilt Larceny from
http://www.larcenists.org/download.html if you don't have Larceny
installed.

The below build instructions are for linux on x86, taken from
doc/HOWTO-BUILD. See that document for more details. The instructions
are made for copy-pasting (or even put in a script and just run)

-----
tar -xf larceny-1.3-bin-native-ia32-linux86.tar.gz
git clone https://github.com/larcenists/larceny.git
cd larceny
../larceny-1.3-bin-native-ia32-linux86/larceny <<EOF
(load "setup.sch")
(setup 'scheme: 'larceny 'host: 'linux86 'sassy)
(build-config-files)
(load-compiler)
(build-heap)
(build-runtime)
(build-executable)
(build-larceny-files)
(build-twobit)
(exit)
EOF
./larceny.bin -stopcopy -- src/Build/iasn-larceny-heap.fasl <<EOF
(exit)
EOF
./larceny.bin -stopcopy -- src/Build/iasn-twobit-heap.fasl <<EOF
(exit)
EOF
# At this point, you can delete the prebuilt binaries
cp larceny twobit
./larceny <<EOF
(require 'r7rsmode)
(larceny:compile-r7rs-runtime)
(exit)
EOF
-----

At this point you can just use larceny directly without installing
(e.g. adjust `$PATH` to search for larceny script). See
doc/HOWTO-INSTALL if you really want to install it.

## Sagittarius

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|C and Scheme
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|cmake & make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|TBD
|*Documentation:*|README.md and HACKING
|=====


Sagittarius requires the latest released version installed before you can
build from Git repository. Follow the documentation link below to get
the tarball and install. Remember to add prefix when you run cmake:

-----
tar -xf sagittarius-0.9.5.tar.gz
cd sagittarius-0.9.5
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/.local .
make
make install
-----

Now you can build from Git, the steps are almost identical as before
except the new step `./dist.sh gen`:

-----
git clone https://bitbucket.org/ktakashi/sagittarius-scheme.git
cd sagittarius-scheme
./dist.sh gen
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/.local .
make
make install
-----

## STklos

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|C and Scheme
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|GNU autotools & make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|5 minutes
|*Documentation:*|`HACKING.md`
|=====

-----
git clone https://github.com/egallesio/STklos.git stklos
cd stklos
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make install
-----

### Troubleshooting

If you made changes to the Scheme code (or pulled changes from Git)
and they are not being propagated to the final executable when you run
`make`, try `touch lib/boot.stk`.
